# PHP-Radio
A simple demonstration of the command pattern, creating a fake dashboard radio purely in PHP/HTML

Realistically, a radio like this would never be written in PHP and so the purpose of this code isn't to be functional.  

Rather, it is merely a portfolio project to demonstrate code that is well written, well documented, and moderately complex.
